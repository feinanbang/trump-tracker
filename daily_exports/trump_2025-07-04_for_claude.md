The people of the United States of America will be Richer, Safer, and Prouder than ever before. Thank you to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and all of the wonderful Republican Members of Congress who helped us deliver on our Promises, and so much more. Together, we can do things that were not even imagined possible less than one year ago. We will keep working, and winning — CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!

The wonderful Newt Gingrich has just written a book that is the talk of D.C. It’s called, “TRUMP’S TRIUMPH, America’s Greatest Comeback.” Word is that it’s Fantastic, but I haven’t read it yet - I’ve been a little too busy. When I do I’ll let you know what I think, but Newt always does it right!!! BUY A COPY NOW.
